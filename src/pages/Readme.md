# Pages

This folder contains all routable pages in the application, along with their relevant subpages and logic.

## Purpose

- Define the URL structure of the application.
- Organize page-level components, layouts, and logic.
- Serve as the entry point for rendering UI using reusable components/ and logic from modules/.

## What You Can Include

- Page-specific components and layout structure.
- Logic, data fetching, and side effects related to the specific page.
- Subfolders for nested routes or page groups.

## What Not to Do

- Do not place reusable UI components here — use the components/ folder for that.
- Do not store shared business logic or API integrations — use the modules/ folder instead.
